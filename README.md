a crude script you may need when working on linux without a gui web browser to access the AHU net   

## Usage

you need to change `user_account` and `user_password` in this script (and it is also commented on), then just execute it   

you can ignore the output (it's just for debug)   

## Note

only for your reference because it just works rather than works fine that can handle unusual errors considering the simple utility   

you can translate it to any programming languages but I code it in python for its common use and lower-level need on linux    

forgive that there may be many useless params in requests without verifying (I can't deal with it yet because I have no access to the LAN remotely \>\_<|||)
